//! Connecting a client to the agent, handshake and all.
//!
//! Every client — the settings app, the overlay helper, the CLI — has to
//! connect, wrap the stream, spawn the tarpc client, check the agent's protocol
//! version, and declare what kind of client it is before any real RPC. That
//! sequence is a policy, and a policy every consumer must apply identically has
//! exactly one owner. This module exports the *decision* — [`connect_as`]
//! either yields a usable [`AgentClient`] or says why not in [`ConnectError`] —
//! and keeps the ingredients (the raw version number, the declare call) out of
//! the public surface, so no consumer can recombine them a second way.
//!
//! The one caller that legitimately judges a version without declaring itself
//! is the agent's own takeover handshake, which must recognise an *older* lock
//! holder without waking it. It gets [`probe_version`] and judges the answer
//! with [`ProtocolSkew::check`], the same rule.
//!
//! Both entry points reach the socket and finish the handshake within
//! [`HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`], so no caller wraps them in a timeout of its own: an
//! agent that cannot accept a connection and answer the two handshake calls
//! from memory in that window is wedged, not busy.
//!
//! The rest of what every observing client repeats lives here too, as
//! [`Observer`]: a connection that owns its generation ledger and keeps
//! exactly one observe call in flight, under a request deadline that outlasts
//! the agent's hold.
