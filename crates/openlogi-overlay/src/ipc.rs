//! The overlay's IPC client: connecting to the agent, receiving ring
//! invocations, and reporting what the user does with them.
//!
//! Reporting is not fire-and-forget. A hover that never lands leaves the ring
//! showing the wrong slot, and a dropped activation loses the user's click
//! outright — so terminal commands retry until the session's own deadline. A
//! newer command for the same ring supersedes a stalled one rather than
//! queueing behind it, which is what keeps the ring responsive when the agent
//! is briefly slow.
